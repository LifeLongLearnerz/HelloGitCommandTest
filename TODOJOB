This is the file which descripts to-do-jobs for better test for git commands.
First of all, we have to add the sample files for C, C++, Python and any other 
computer languages such as HelloWorld.c, HelloWorld.cpp, HelloAndroid.java. 
If you have a time, you can feel free to add this source files. Let us index 
the to-do-jobs as followings:

1. add the sample C source/header files and makefile.
2. add the sample C++ source/header files and makefile.

Last what I have to say is that above added files sould be certain right after 
succedding to be compiled with pc compiler(eg: gcc, g++) on Linux(eg:Ubuntu).
Any of you can also add the items to do more about this repository.
